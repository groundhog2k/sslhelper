Simple OpenSSL bash scripts to make generating self signed SSL certificates easy

setconfig
                       - Sets OPENSSL_CONF to openssl.cnf in this folder (should always be first called script)


genkey name
                       - Generates a new key-pair and stores it as "name" with suffix .key

genreq name
                       - Creates a new certificate signing request (based on key-pair "name") and stores it as "name" with suffix .CSR

genrootcert name numofdays
                       - Generates a new root certificate based on request "name" and key "name" - valid for "numofdays" days

genimcert name caname numofdays 
                       - Generates a new intermediate certificate based on request "name" and ca certificate "caname" - valid for "numofdays" days

genservercert name caname numofdays
                       - Generates a new server (HTTPS) certificate based on request "name" and ca certificate "caname" - valid for "numofdays" days

genclientcert name caname numofdays
                       - Generates a new client authentication certificate based on request "name" and ca certificate "caname" - valid for "numofdays" days


openssl.cnf
                       - default openssl configuration file
openssl.ext
                       - openssl extension for server and client authentication certificates
Readme
                       - This file

Examples:

- Generating a new root certificate:
genkey MyRoot
genreq MyRoot

genreq MyServer
genservercert MyServer MyRoot 365
